CHMOD
===========
When using chmod, you need to be aware that there are three types of Linux users that you are setting permissions for.
Therefore, when setting permissions, you are assigning them for "yourself", "your group" and "everyone else" in the world.
These users are technically know as:

● Owner (User)
● Group
● World

chmod <owner> <group> <world> <FileName>

There are three types of permissions that Linux allows for each file.
● read
● write
● execute

● 4 – read (r)
● 2 – write (w)
● 1 – execute (x)

chmod 400 mydoc.txt – read by owner
chmod 040 mydoc.txt – read by group
chmod 004 mydoc.txt – read by anybody (other)
chmod 200 mydoc.txt – write by owner
chmod 020 mydoc.txt – write by group
chmod 002 mydoc.txt – write by anybody
chmod 100 mydoc.txt – execute by owner
chmod 010 mydoc.txt – execute by group
chmod 001 mydoc.txt – execute by anybody

7 = 4+2+1 (read/write/execute)
6 = 4+2 (read/write)
5 = 4+1 (read/execute)
4 = 4 (read)
3 = 2+1 (write/execute)
2 = 2 (write)
1 = 1 (execute)

chmod 666 mydoc.txt – read/write by anybody! (the devil loves this one!)
chmod 755 mydoc.txt – rwx for owner, rx for group and rx for the world
chmod 777 mydoc.txt – read, write, execute for all! (may not be the best plan in the world...


BASH Shell
